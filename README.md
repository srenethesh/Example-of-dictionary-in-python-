## What is dictionary?
A dictionary in programming is a collection of key-value pairs. 
It is a data structure that allows you to store and retrieve values using a unique key associated with each value. 
Dictionaries are sometimes referred to as maps, hash maps, or associative arrays in other programming languages.

### Here's a simple example:
my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}
